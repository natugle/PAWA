# PAWA
PascalCoin Wallet - connects to the network through the JSON RPC API

PAWA is simple and easy to use but is still in an early test stage. It still needs a lot of work to get finished.

Compile with Lazarus 1.8.2 and FPC 3.0.4. or newer. Can be compiled for both Windows and Linux and both 32 and 64 bit.
